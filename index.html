          <p>
         The SGDA game jam is a 48 hour event where student game developers get together to create awesome games! 
            These games will be based off of a theme which will be announced at the day of the event. Our game jam 
            will consist of workshops that will teach you the ins and outs of game development and professionals who 
            will provide adequate feedback on your game. This is a great opportunity for those who want to collaborate 
            with other fellow game developers to experiment on riveting new projects! This year we are collaborating with 
            the Global Game Jam &copy; and will be hosting two sites for Northern and Southern California.

            The SGDA summit is an all-day gathering of student, indie, and professional game developers. This is a great
